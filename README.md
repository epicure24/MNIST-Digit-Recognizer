# MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
This Repo has deep learning classifiers to recognize MNIST Digits from 0 to 9.

# NOTEBOOK 1

## Visualizing_MNIST.ipynb
It is a notebook that plots MNIST dataset that has 784 pixels and 42000 datapoints in 2 Dimensions using PCA. I have used PCA to squash 784 features into 330 features that retains 99% of the variance.

# NOTEBOOK 2

## mnist-digit-recognition-using-cnn-0-99-accuracy.ipynb 
It is a CNN classifier that predicts the digits with 99% accuracy.
